# Identifying-POI-with-Machine-Learning-in-Python
The widespread fraudulent practices of then one of the largest company operating in energy, commodities, and services, known as ENRON resulted in bankruptcy in the year 2002. The subsequent investigation of this corporate fraud, led to publicizing confidential information, including emails and financial data pertaining to top level executives. Although due to sensitivity, the information was pulled back, but there is still a major chunk of it that sits in the public record even today.  I aim to use that chunk of public record to build a ‘Person of Interest’ identifier, whereas a POI is formally defined as an individual who was indicted, reached a settlement, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity. Machine learning tools are employed for this classification task, and the features broadly falls in either email features or financial features.
